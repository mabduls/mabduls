🚀 Passionate Full-Stack JavaScript Developer | 🎓 Informatics Undergraduate at Universitas Diponegoro

I’m a highly motivated Informatics student at Diponegoro University, deeply passionate about building responsive and scalable web applications using JavaScript technologies. Currently, I'm sharpening my skills in React, Node.js, and RESTful APIs through the Full Stack JavaScript Developer path at Coding Camp Powered by DBS Foundation.

In addition, I’m an alumnus of Bangkit Academy 2024, a program supported by Google, GOTO, and Traveloka, where I specialized in Mobile Development using Kotlin, giving me strong fundamentals in clean architecture and performance optimization.

I enjoy working with both frontend and backend stacks, with a particular interest in frontend technologies such as React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and ensuring seamless API integration. I also explore machine learning implementation in web apps using TensorFlow.js.

🔐 I value writing secure, maintainable code and have a growing interest in web security. I'm continuously learning and excited to contribute to impactful tech projects.

💼 Currently open to full-time opportunities in full-stack JavaScript roles, especially those involving React, Node.js, and RESTful APIs.
